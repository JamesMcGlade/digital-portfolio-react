        <h1>Hello there! I'm James!</h1>
        <p>I was born and raised in Spain. My father is Scottish so I had the good fortune to have both a Spanish and a Scottish family, and I also have dual nationality.</p>
        <p>From an early age Iâ€™ve always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work that first sparked this interest. I can always remember the feeling of wanting to know just how computers applications worked, why they worked and what else they could do...I first became interested in video and photo editing when I was a teenager, learning how to use different editing programs: video, (Windows Movie Maker, Sony vegas and Wondershare Filmora), image (Photoshop) and audio (Audacity).</p>
        <p>My academic and professional background was not related to programming or IT whatsoever. I began studying law back in Spain and it was during the last year of my degree when I started to become interested in IT and especially programming. So much so that I wrote my dissertation on IT copyright, and in order to gain a deeper knowledge about the subject, I started looking into coding and software developer skills until suddenly I realized that this was a career that I really wanted to pursue and where I really could add value with my business and international law background.</p>
        <p>Last year I enrolled in the Development course at Code Nation and it was only then I started to see the tip of the iceberg of the potential that a deep understanding on Software engineering and IT functionality brings to business. I really enjoyed working in a team programming several tasks and projects using Python and JavaScript. Thanks to Code Nation I've learned not only a new set of skills but also discovered a new passion.</p>
        <p>The world of computers is growing at an un-recordable rate everyday, computers are the most influential tools in our lives, they are our present and future. In my opinion nothing on the planet can measure the growth and excitement in the computing industry, an industry which I want to be a part of, particularly in Software Programming. It is this passion that will prompt me to always go that extra mile, whether to get the job done or to continue learning.</p>
